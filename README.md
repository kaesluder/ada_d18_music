# Digital Marketplaces

### Bandcamp

Link: [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com)

Bandcamp is an marketplace centered on alternative-label and self-published music. Overall quality can 
really vary but it's possible to find some rare loves on the pay-what-you-want tier, along with 
really niche projects. Better compensation than a lot of streaming services. 

Pros: Good compensation and artist connection, chuckle-worthy projects

Cons: Can be hard to find good material, low participation by major labels.
